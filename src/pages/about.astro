  <section>
    <h2>Your Ironman Journey Partner</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Chelsea Seymour, an Ironman athlete and triathlon coach dedicated to helping 
      you achieve your endurance goals. My passion for swimming, cycling, and running 
      drives everything I do, and I love sharing that passion with my athletes.
    </p>
    <p>
      My coaching philosophy centers on building sustainable training habits, improving 
      technique (especially in the swim!), and creating personalized plans that fit your 
      unique lifestyle. Whether you're balancing training with work and family or going 
      all-in on your Ironman dream, I'll meet you where you are and help you get to where 
      you want to be.

    <h2>Why Train With Me?</h2>
    <p>
      I get it—training for an Ironman or triathlon is tough! Between work, family, 
      and life's other demands, finding time to train can feel overwhelming. That's 
      where I come in. My coaching is flexible, realistic, and designed to fit your 
      life, not the other way around.
    </p>
    <p>
      From sprint distance to full Ironman, I'll be your biggest cheerleader and 
      trusted guide. Together, we'll build a training plan that gets results while 
      keeping you healthy, motivated, and excited about race day.
